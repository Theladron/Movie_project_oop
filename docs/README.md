# Movie Project - Object Oriented Programming
is designed for showcasing the oop-approach to the former movie project. Works with the api
[The Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Key Features
* Search for and add, remove, update movies and their stats in omdb API database
  * Shows movie poster, name, rating and comments for added movies
* Supports multiple users and files, creating a new json/cvs file for each user
* Creates an HTML page for the current movie database
  * Converts it's design to maintain a clean appearance for every device
    

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies
If you want to use the data fetcher, you need to grab a key from https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
and create a .env file containing your personal api key, The .env just needs the following line:
API_KEY="your key"

## Usage

To use this project, run the following command - "python main.py"
remember to first create your own .env file or update the API_KEY variable in movie_app.py
with your own api key.

## Contributing

I allways welcome contributions and suggestions. Remember however that this is an exercise
from the masterschool SE learning course, and therefor I might not find the time to revisit the project
once it's finished and graded.
